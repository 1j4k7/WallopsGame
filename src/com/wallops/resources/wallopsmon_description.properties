#################################################

Arbok=The pattern on its belly appears to be a frightening face. Weak foes will flee just at the sight of the pattern.
Bald_Eagle=Symbol of the United States. Its wingspan ranges from 72 to 90 inches, have over 7,000 feathers, can live as long as thirty years, they are excellent swimmers, lay one to three eggs, both parents share incubation of the eggs, there are an estimated 9,789 breeding pairs of bald eagles. They mainly eat fish, but would also eat carrion. Once mated, a pair of bald eagles will stay together until one dies. At June 28, 2007, The Department of Interior took the American bald eagle off the endangered species list.
Beedrill=It has three poisonous stingers on its forelegs and its tail. They are used to jab its enemy repeatedly.
Blastoise=It crushes its foe under its heavy body to cause fainting. In a pinch, it will withdraw inside its shell.
Bulbasaur=A strange seed was planted on its back at birth. The plant sprouts and grows with this Pokémon.
Butterfree=It loves the honey of flowers and can locate flower patches that have even tiny amounts of pollen.
Caterpie=For protection, it releases a horrible stench from the antennae on its head to drive away enemies.
Charizard=When expelling a blast of superhot fire, the red flame at the tip of its tail burns more intensely.
Charmander=The flame on its tail indicates Charmander's life force. If it is healthy, the flame burns brightly.
Charmeleon=It lashes about with its tail to knock down its foe. It then tears up the fallen opponent with sharp claws.
Clefable=Its hearing is so acute it can hear a pin drop over half a mile away. It lives on quiet mountains.
Clefairy=It is said that happiness will come to those who see a gathering of Clefairy dancing under a full moon.
Ekans=The older it gets, the longer it grows. At night, it wraps its long body around tree branches to rest.
Fearow=With its huge and magnificent wings, it can keep aloft without ever having to land or rest.
Gloom=Smells incredibly foul! However, around one out of a thousand people enjoy sniffing its nose-bending stink.
Golbat=Once it bites, it will not stop draining energy from the victim even if it gets too heavy to fly.
Horseshoe_Crab=Horseshoe crab, aka Limulus polyphemus, is found in North America along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts from Maine to Mexico. The other three species are found in Southeast Asia. Horseshoe crabs are not true crabs at all. Horseshoe crabs are more closely related to arachnids (a group that includes spiders and scorpions) than to crustaceans (a group that includes true crabs, lobsters, and shrimp).  Horseshoe crabs are often called "living fossils" because fossils of their ancestors date back almost 450 million years--that's 200 million years before dinosaurs existed. \nThe strange anatomy of the horseshoe crab is one of this animal's most notable aspects. Unfortunately, the long, thin, spike-like tail of horseshoe crabs has given this species an unfavorable reputation. Many people view horseshoe crabs as dangerous animals because they have sharp tails. In reality, horseshoe crabs are harmless.  Their tails are used primarily to flip themselves upright if they are accidentally overturned. \nHorseshoe crabs are extremely important to the biomedical industry because their unique, copper-based blue blood contains a substance called Limulus amebocyte lysate. The substance, which coagulates in the presence of small amounts of bacterial toxins, is used to test for sterility of medical equipment and virtually all intravenous drugs. Research on the compound eyes of horseshoe crabs has led to a better understanding of human vision.
Ivysaur=There is a plant bulb on its back. When it absorbs nutrients, the bulb is said to blossom into a large flower.
Jigglypuff=It captivates foes with its huge, round eyes, then lulls them to sleep by singing a soothing melody.
Kakuna=Almost incapable of moving, this Pokémon can only harden its shell to protect itself when it is in danger.
Loblolly_Pine=Loblolly Pines are large trees, growing up to 100 feet tall. Loblolly Pines grow in forests and fields. In fields, they are a pioneer tree, meaning they are one of the first trees to grow. Leaves are needles, in clusters of three, with each one being about six or seven inches long. Needles stay green all year. In Wallops, they form the Maritime Forest. To maintain their hold on the ground, the pines shed their needles, which are quite acidic, to prevent any other plants from growing there.
Mantis_Shrimp=(Go here: http://theoatmeal.com/comics/mantis_shrimp) \nMantis Shrimp have 16 color receptor cones, as opposed to the three humans have (RGB). The rainbow we see is composed of the 3 colors we see. Imagine what kind of rainbow is made from 16 colors. \nThe mantis shrimp has two raptor-like appendages in front of its body, that can accelerate to the velocity of a bullet fired from a 22-caliber rifle, in less than 3 thousandths of a second, delivering 1500 Newtons of force. To put that into perspective, if human beings could accelerate their arms one tenth of that speed, we'd be able to throw baseballs into orbit. Their arms move so fast, the water around them boils in a process called supercavitation. When these cavitation bubbles collapse, they create a shockwave strong enough to kill the shrimp's prey, even if it misses with the punch. The force of the collapsing bubbles produces temperatures in the ranges of several thousand degrees Kelvin, and emit tiny bursts of light. \nAnd how it uses these "murder sticks"? It dismembers its prey by punching it repeatedly until food comes. And, as you might imagine, their arms are very resilient. So resilient, in fact, that scientists have been studying their cell structure to develop advanced body armor. They aren't housed in aquariums, because they kill all the animals in them. And break the aquariums too.
Metapod=A steel-hard shell protects its tender body. It quietly endures hardships while awaiting evolution.
Mud_Dog_Whelk=The mud dog whelk (also called eastern mud nassa, eastern mud snail, mud basket shell, common mud snail) is about of an inch in length.\nIt has a chalky white shell, but is covered by a dark brown to red-brown periostracum.  It has 6 whirls and an operculum.\nThese snails form large clusters that tend to be divided into age groups. They are always found in large numbers, sometimes in the hundreds of thousands.\nMud snails are scavengers and can be attracted to bait or dead fish.\nThe snails leave a mucous trail as they glide along the bottom. The mucous is a chemical trail marker. Other snails will find the trail and follow it. The only time this does not seem to hold true is if one of the snails is sick or injured. The other snails will quickly abandon the unfortunate snail.
Nidoking=It is recognized by its rock-hard hide and its extended horn. Be careful with the horn, as it contains venom.
Nidoqueen=It uses its scaly, rugged body to seal the entrance of its nest and protect its young from predators.
Nidoran\u2640=Although small, its venomous barbs render this Pokémon dangerous. The female has smaller horns.
Nidoran\u2642=It scans its surroundings by raising its ears out of the grass. Its toxic horn is for protection.
Nidorina=The female has a gentle temperament. It emits ultrasonic cries that have the power to befuddle foes.
Nidorino=It raises its big ears to check its surroundings. If it senses anything, it attacks immediately.
Ninetales=It has nine long tails and fur that gleams gold. It is said to live for 1,000 years.
Oddish=During the day, it stays in the cold underground to avoid the sun. It grows by bathing in moonlight.
Paras=Growing out of the bug's back are mushrooms called tochukaso. The mushrooms grow with the bug host.
Parasect=A mushroom grown larger than the host's body controls Parasect. It scatters poisonous spores.
Pidgeot=When hunting, it skims the surface of water at high speed to pick off unwary prey such as Magikarp.
Pidgeotto=The claws on its feet are well developed. It can carry prey such as an Exeggcute to its nest over 60 miles away.
Pidgey=A common sight in forests and woods. It flaps its wings at ground level to kick up blinding sand.
Pikachu=It raises its tail to check its surroundings. The tail is sometimes struck by lightning in this pose.
Raichu=When its electricity builds, its muscles are stimulated, and it becomes more aggressive than usual.
Raticate=It whittles its constantly growing fangs by gnawing on hard things. It can chew apart cinder walls.
Rattata=Living wherever there is food available, it ceaselessly scavenges for edibles the entire day.
Sandshrew=It burrows and lives underground. If threatened, it curls itself up into a ball for protection.
Sandslash=If it digs at an incredible pace, it may snap off its spikes and claws. They grow back in a day.
Sea_Pork=Sea pork, Aplidium stellatum is a colonial tunicate that forms tough, globular colonies that measure an inch or more in height and are rubbery or cartilaginous to the touch.  Zooids are red and are arranged in circular groups under the tunic, which is creamy pink to purple in color.  Colonies can become large, spreading 12 inches or more. \nSea pork is subtidal, found from the low tide line to depths of approximately 30 feet.  Colonies grow on hard substrates such as mangrove roots, rock jetties, pilings and floating docks. \nSea pork got its name because after death, the rubbery tunic bleaches to white, resembling salt pork or fatback. \n\n\nI propose a more apt name: "Sea Cancer".
Spearow=Very protective of its territory, it flaps its short wings busily to dart around at high speed.
Squirtle=It shelters itself in its shell, then strikes back with spouts of water at every opportunity.
Tick=Ticks are Arachnids. Parasites. They live off the blood of mammals, birds, and sometime reptiles and amphibians. Theyare vectors of a number of diseases, including Lyme disease, Colorado tick fever, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, African tick bite fever, tularemia, tick-borne relapsing fever, babesiosis, ehrlichiosis, Tick paralysis, and tick-borne meningoencephalitis, as well as bovine anaplasmosis and probably the Heartland virus. They live either hidden in foliage or drinking blood from their prey. Also, they are very difficult to get rid of, as they are tiny, hide, and are very difficult to kill. They don't drown, burn, suffocate, or anything. In fact, if you take them off the wrong way, you get their head stuck in your skin. Not fun. \nTL;DR: they are tiny, virtually indestructable little buggers, related to spiders (and potentially vampires), and carry more diseases than humans have fingers.
Venomoth=The scales it scatters will paralyze anyone who touches them, making that person unable to stand.
Venonat=Its big eyes are actually clusters of tiny eyes. At night, its kind is drawn by light.
Venusaur=By spreading the broad petals of its flower and catching the sun's rays, it fills its body with power.
Vileplume=The larger its petals, the more toxic pollen it contains. Its big head is heavy and hard to hold up.
Vulpix=When it is born, it has just one snow-white tail. The tail splits from its tip as it grows older.
Wartortle=When tapped, this Pokémon will pull in its head, but its tail will still stick out a little bit.
Weedle=Often found in forests and grasslands. It has a sharp, toxic barb of around two inches on top of its head.
Wigglytuff=Their fur feels so good that if two of them snuggle together, they won't want to be separated.
Zubat=Even though it has no eyes, it can sense obstacles using ultrasonic waves it emits from it mouth.
