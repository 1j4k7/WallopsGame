WallopsGame
===========
So, this is a project the two of us have taken on for our Biology class.
This is a game where you encounter animals that live on or near Wallops Island, VA, USA.
Here, very similarly to Pokemon, you (would be able to) battle and catch "Wallopsmon" (a spinoff on "Pokemon," duh).

If you want to download the project and work on it, this project is our eclipse workspace, and uses the Java SE 6 library. 
Additionally, we use the following libraries:
1. The lwjgl library (specifically lwjgl.jar and lwjgl_util.jar) for graphics, and can be found at http://lwjgl.org/
2. The log4j2 library (specifically log4j-api-2.0.2.jar and log4j-core-2.0.2.jar) for logging, and can be found at http://logging.apache.org/
3. The slick utility library (specifically slick-util.jar) as a helper to lwjgl and for reference, and can be found at http://slick.ninjacave.com/slick-util/

This is for educational, non-profit use only. Pokémon is a trademark held by Nintendo. We do not claim any rights to that.
HOWEVER: the code had been written by the two of us, with help from publicly available formulas independantly derived from Pokémon.
This project is protected under the Creative Common Liscence. 
Additionally to what is declared in that document, if you do use any of this code, please give us credit. It would also be much preffered if you notified us, as we'd love to work with you and know that we helped someone!
