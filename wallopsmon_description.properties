Mud_Dog_Whelk=The mud dog whelk (also called eastern mud nassa, eastern mud snail, mud basket shell, common mud snail) is about of an inch in length.\nIt has a chalky white shell, but is covered by a dark brown to red-brown periostracum.  It has 6 whirls and an operculum.\nThese snails form large clusters that tend to be divided into age groups. They are always found in large numbers, sometimes in the hundreds of thousands.\nMud snails are scavengers and can be attracted to bait or dead fish.\nThe snails leave a mucous trail as they glide along the bottom. The mucous is a chemical trail marker. Other snails will find the trail and follow it. The only time this does not seem to hold true is if one of the snails is sick or injured. The other snails will quickly abandon the unfortunate snail.

Horseshoe_Crab=Horseshoe crab, aka Limulus polyphemus, is found in North America along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts from Maine to Mexico. The other three species are found in Southeast Asia. Horseshoe crabs are not true crabs at all. Horseshoe crabs are more closely related to arachnids (a group that includes spiders and scorpions) than to crustaceans (a group that includes true crabs, lobsters, and shrimp).  Horseshoe crabs are often called "living fossils" because fossils of their ancestors date back almost 450 million years--that's 200 million years before dinosaurs existed. \nThe strange anatomy of the horseshoe crab is one of this animal's most notable aspects. Unfortunately, the long, thin, spike-like tail of horseshoe crabs has given this species an unfavorable reputation. Many people view horseshoe crabs as dangerous animals because they have sharp tails. In reality, horseshoe crabs are harmless.  Their tails are used primarily to flip themselves upright if they are accidentally overturned. \nHorseshoe crabs are extremely important to the biomedical industry because their unique, copper-based blue blood contains a substance called Limulus amebocyte lysate. The substance, which coagulates in the presence of small amounts of bacterial toxins, is used to test for sterility of medical equipment and virtually all intravenous drugs. Research on the compound eyes of horseshoe crabs has led to a better understanding of human vision.

Sea_Pork=Sea pork, Aplidium stellatum is a colonial tunicate that forms tough, globular colonies that measure an inch or more in height and are rubbery or cartilaginous to the touch.  Zooids are red and are arranged in circular groups under the tunic, which is creamy pink to purple in color.  Colonies can become large, spreading 12 inches or more. \nSea pork is subtidal, found from the low tide line to depths of approximately 30 feet.  Colonies grow on hard substrates such as mangrove roots, rock jetties, pilings and floating docks. \nSea pork got its name because after death, the rubbery tunic bleaches to white, resembling salt pork or fatback. \n\n\nI propose a more apt name: "Sea Cancer".
