Mud_Dog_Whelk=The mud dog whelk (also called eastern mud nassa, eastern mud snail, mud basket shell, common mud snail) is about of an inch in length.\nIt has a chalky white shell, but is covered by a dark brown to red-brown periostracum.  It has 6 whirls and an operculum.\nThese snails form large clusters that tend to be divided into age groups. They are always found in large numbers, sometimes in the hundreds of thousands.\nMud snails are scavengers and can be attracted to bait or dead fish.\nThe snails leave a mucous trail as they glide along the bottom. The mucous is a chemical trail marker. Other snails will find the trail and follow it. The only time this does not seem to hold true is if one of the snails is sick or injured. The other snails will quickly abandon the unfortunate snail.

Horseshoe_Crab=Horseshoe crab, aka Limulus polyphemus, is found in North America along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts from Maine to Mexico. The other three species are found in Southeast Asia. Horseshoe crabs are not true crabs at all. Horseshoe crabs are more closely related to arachnids (a group that includes spiders and scorpions) than to crustaceans (a group that includes true crabs, lobsters, and shrimp).  Horseshoe crabs are often called "living fossils" because fossils of their ancestors date back almost 450 million years--that's 200 million years before dinosaurs existed. \nThe strange anatomy of the horseshoe crab is one of this animal's most notable aspects. Unfortunately, the long, thin, spike-like tail of horseshoe crabs has given this species an unfavorable reputation. Many people view horseshoe crabs as dangerous animals because they have sharp tails. In reality, horseshoe crabs are harmless.  Their tails are used primarily to flip themselves upright if they are accidentally overturned. \nHorseshoe crabs are extremely important to the biomedical industry because their unique, copper-based blue blood contains a substance called Limulus amebocyte lysate. The substance, which coagulates in the presence of small amounts of bacterial toxins, is used to test for sterility of medical equipment and virtually all intravenous drugs. Research on the compound eyes of horseshoe crabs has led to a better understanding of human vision.

Sea_Pork=Sea pork, Aplidium stellatum is a colonial tunicate that forms tough, globular colonies that measure an inch or more in height and are rubbery or cartilaginous to the touch.  Zooids are red and are arranged in circular groups under the tunic, which is creamy pink to purple in color.  Colonies can become large, spreading 12 inches or more. \nSea pork is subtidal, found from the low tide line to depths of approximately 30 feet.  Colonies grow on hard substrates such as mangrove roots, rock jetties, pilings and floating docks. \nSea pork got its name because after death, the rubbery tunic bleaches to white, resembling salt pork or fatback. \n\n\nI propose a more apt name: "Sea Cancer". 

Mantis_Shrimp=(Go here: http://theoatmeal.com/comics/mantis_shrimp) \nMantis Shrimp have 16 color receptor cones, as opposed to the three humans have (RGB). The rainbow we see is composed of the 3 colors we see. Imagine what kind of rainbow is made from 16 colors. \nThe mantis shrimp has two raptor-like appendages in front of its body, that can accelerate to the velocity of a bullet fired from a 22-caliber rifle, in less than 3 thousandths of a second, delivering 1500 Newtons of force. To put that into perspective, if human beings could accelerate their arms one tenth of that speed, we'd be able to throw baseballs into orbit. Their arms move so fast, the water around them boils in a process called supercavitation. When these cavitation bubbles collapse, they create a shockwave strong enough to kill the shrimp's prey, even if it misses with the punch. The force of the collapsing bubbles produces temperatures in the ranges of several thousand degrees Kelvin, and emit tiny bursts of light. \nAnd how it uses these "murder sticks"? It dismembers its prey by punching it repeatedly until food comes. And, as you might imagine, their arms are very resilient. So resilient, in fact, that scientists have been studying their cell structure to develop advanced body armor. They aren't housed in aquariums, because they kill all the animals in them. And break the aquariums too. 

Tick=Ticks are Arachnids. Parasites. They live off the blood of mammals, birds, and sometime reptiles and amphibians. They are vectors of a number of diseases, including Lyme disease, Colorado tick fever, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, African tick bite fever, tularemia, tick-borne relapsing fever, babesiosis, ehrlichiosis, Tick paralysis, and tick-borne meningoencephalitis, as well as bovine anaplasmosis and probably the Heartland virus. They live either hidden in foliage or drinking blood from their prey. Also, they are very difficult to get rid of, as they are tiny, hide, and are very difficult to kill. They don't drown, burn, suffocate, or anything. In fact, if you take them off the wrong way, you get their head stuck in your skin. Not fun. \nTL;DR: they are tiny, virtually indestructable little buggers, related to spiders (and potentially vampires), and carry more diseases than humans have fingers.

Loblolly_Pine=Loblolly Pines are large trees, growing up to 100 feet tall. Loblolly Pines grow in forests and fields. In fields, they are a pioneer tree, meaning they are one of the first trees to grow. Leaves are needles, in clusters of three, with each one being about six or seven inches long. Needles stay green all year. In Wallops, they form the Maritime Forest. To maintain their hold on the ground, the pines shed their needles, which are quite acidic, to prevent any other plants from growing there. 

Bald_Eagle=Symbol of the United States. Its wingspan ranges from 72 to 90 inches, have over 7,000 feathers, can live as long as thirty years, they are excellent swimmers, lay one to three eggs, both parents share incubation of the eggs, there are an estimated 9,789 breeding pairs of bald eagles. They mainly eat fish, but would also eat carrion. Once mated, a pair of bald eagles will stay together until one dies. At June 28, 2007, The Department of Interior took the American bald eagle off the endangered species list.
